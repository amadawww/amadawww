- 👋 Hi, I’m @amadawww， currently I work as a product assistant. I have a plan of working aboard one day.
- 👀 I’m interested in community and, in general, social aspect. I focus a lot on how people interact with each other. It's complicated that people communicate with eatch other in their own ways and thats mistery but attracting to me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing. I dont need to code in my current position, but that doesnt mean I hate coding or what, but just I have no basic knowledge of any kind of coding languages. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on community like discord, zoom, ins, facebook, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me ...just via github haha, I like the UI design of this platform.
